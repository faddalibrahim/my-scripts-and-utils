"""
This script is intended to generate lines of sql code for insert operations
A text file containing the lines of data to be inserted is required
Pkus a table to be inserted into

the getData() functions reads the data file and returns a list of the data
this is then passed into the sqlise() function to generate the sql code

if the data file contains this data:
	1232021,"C090904","John Dramani Mahama","male","2000-06-13","NDC",0)
	1232022,"C090904","Nana Addo-Danquah Akuffo Addo","male","2000-06-13","NPP",0)
	1232023,"C090904","Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings","female","2000-06-13","NDP",0)
	1232024,"C090904","Ayariga Moses","male","2000-06-13","PNC",0)

and the table name entered is Presidents

ths outpute file generate will contain this:
	insert into Presidents values(1232021,"C090904","John Dramani Mahama","male","2000-06-13","NDC",0)
	insert into Presidents values(1232022,"C090904","Nana Addo-Danquah Akuffo Addo","male","2000-06-13","NPP",0)
	insert into Presidents values(1232023,"C090904","Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings","female","2000-06-13","NDP",0)
	insert into Presidents values(1232024,"C090904","Ayariga Moses","male","2000-06-13","PNC",0)


NB: this script can be easily modified to work with csv files



#TODO : check for empty data files to avoid generating an empty output
		convert into bash
		modify to work with csv files
		Look at how to incorporate os.path.exists()
